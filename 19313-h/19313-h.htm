<p class="italic"><span class="i0">Our tears, our songs, our laurels&mdash;what are these</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee in thy Gethsemane of loss,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stretched in thine unimagined agonies</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On Hell's last engine of the Iron Cross.</span></p>

<p class="italic"><span class="i0">For such a world as this that thou shouldst die</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is price too vast&mdash;yet, Belgium, hadst thou sold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thyself, O then had fled from out the earth</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour for ever, and left only Gold.</span></p>

<p class="italic"><span class="i0">Nor diest thou&mdash;for soon shalt thou awake,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lifted high on our victorious shields,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Watch the new sunrise driving for your sons</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The hated German shadow from your fields.</span></p>

<blockquote><p class="italic"><a class="pagebreak" name="page10" id="page10" title="10"></a>&ldquo;British colonists resident in London volunteer, and

<h2><a class="pagebreak" name="page11" id="page11" title="11"></a>THE SILK-HAT SOLDIER</h2>

<p><span class="i0">I saw him in a picture, and I felt I'd like to cry&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in line,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man &ldquo;for mine,&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A tall silk-hatted &ldquo;guy&rdquo;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right on the call,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk hat and all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He'd hurried to the cry&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For he loves England well enough for England to die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">I've seen King Harry's helmet in the Abbey hanging high&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one he wore</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Agincourt;</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page12" id="page12" title="12"></a>But braver to my eye</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That city toff</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too keen to doff</span><br />
<span class="i0">His stove-pipe&mdash;bless him&mdash;why?</span><br />
<span class="i0">For he loves England well enough for England to die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And other fellows in that line had come too on the fly,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their joys and toys,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave English boys,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For good and all put by;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O you brave best,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach all the rest</span><br />
<span class="i0">How pure the heart and high</span><br />
<span class="i0">When one loves England well enough for England to die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">One threw his cricket-bat aside, one left the ink to dry;</span><br />
<span class="i2"><a class="pagebreak" name="page13" id="page13" title="13"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All peace and play</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's put away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And bid his love good-bye&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O mother mine!</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sweetheart mine!</span><br />
<span class="i0">No man of yours am I&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If I love not England well enough for England to die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">I guess it strikes a chill somewhere, the bravest won't deny,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that you love,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away to shove,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And set your teeth to die;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But better dead,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all is said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than lapped in peace to lie&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If we love not England well enough for England to die.</span></p>

<h2><a class="pagebreak" name="page14" id="page14" title="14"></a>THE CRY OF THE LITTLE PEOPLES</h2>

<p><span class="i0">The Cry of the Little Peoples went up to God in vain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Czech and the Pole, and the Finn, and the Schleswig Dane:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">We ask but a little portion of the green, ambitious earth;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">We ask not coaling stations, nor ports in the China seas,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We leave to the big child-nations such rivalries as these.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page15" id="page15" title="15"></a>We have learned the lesson of Time, and we know three things of worth;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">O leave us little margins, waste ends of land and sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A little grass, and a hill or two, and a shadowing tree;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">O leave us our little rivers that sweetly catch the sky,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To drive our mills, and to carry our wood, and to ripple by.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Once long ago, as you, with hollow pursuit of fame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We filled all the shaking world with the sound of our name,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page16" id="page16" title="16"></a>But now are we glad to rest, our battles and boasting done,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Glad just to sow and sing and reap in our share of the sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Of this O will ye rob us,&mdash;with a foolish mighty hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Add with such cruel sorrow, so small a land to your land?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So might a boy rejoice him to conquer a hive of bees,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Overcome ants in battle,&mdash;we are scarcely more mighty than these&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So might a cruel heart hear a nightingale singing alone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And say, &ldquo;I am mighty! See how the singing stops with a stone!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page17" id="page17" title="17"></a>Yea, he were mighty indeed, mighty to crush and to gain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the bee and the ant and the bird were the mighty of brain.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And what shall you gain if you take us and bind us and beat us with thongs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And drive us to sing underground in a whisper our sad little songs?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Forbid us the very use of our heart's own nursery tongue&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is this to be strong, ye nations, is this to be strong?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Your vulgar battles to fight, and your grocery conquests to keep,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For this shall we break our hearts, for this shall our old men weep?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page18" id="page18" title="18"></a>What gain in the day of battle&mdash;to the Russ, to the German, what gain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Czech, and the Pole, and the Finn, and the Schleswig Dane?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Cry of the Little Peoples goes up to God in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the world is given over to the cruel sons of Cain;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The hand that would bless us is weak, and the hand that would break us is strong,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the power of pity is nought but the power of a song.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The dreams that our fathers dreamed to-day are laughter and dust,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And nothing at all in the world is left for a man to trust;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page19" id="page19" title="19"></a>Let us hope no more, or dream, or prophesy, or pray,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the iron world no less will crash on its iron way;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yea! nothing is left but to watch, with a helpless, pitying eye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The kind old aims for the world, and the kind old fashions die.</span></p>

<h2><a class="pagebreak" name="page20" id="page20" title="20"></a>THE ILLUSION OF WAR</h2>

<p><span class="i0">War</span><br />
<span class="i0">I abhor,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And yet how sweet</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sound along the marching street</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of drum and fife, and I forget</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wet eyes of widows, and forget</span><br />
<span class="i0">Broken old mothers, and the whole</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dark butchery without a soul.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Without a soul&mdash;save this bright drink</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of heady music, sweet as hell;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And even my peace-abiding feet</span><br />
<span class="i0">Go marching with the marching street,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page21" id="page21" title="21"></a>For yonder, yonder goes the fife,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And what care I for human life!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The tears fill my astonished eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">And my full heart is like to break,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And yet 'tis all embannered lies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A dream those little drummers make.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">O it is wickedness to clothe</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yon hideous grinning thing that stalks</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hidden in music, like a queen</span><br />
<span class="i0">That in a garden of glory walks,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till good men love the thing they loathe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Art, thou hast many infamies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But not an infamy like this;</span><br />
<span class="i0">O snap the fife and still the drum,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And show the monster as she is.</span></p>

<h2><a class="pagebreak" name="page22" id="page22" title="22"></a>CHRISTMAS IN WAR-TIME</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="i0">This is the year that has no Christmas Day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Even the little children must be told</span><br />
<span class="i0">That something sad is happening far away&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or, if you needs must play,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As children must,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Play softly children, underneath your breath!</span><br />
<span class="i0">For over our hearts hangs low the shadow of death,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page23" id="page23" title="23"></a>Those hearts to you mysteriously old,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Grim grown-up hearts that ponder night and day</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the straight lists of broken-hearted dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Black narrow lists no tears can wash away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Reading in which one cries out here and here</span><br />
<span class="i0">And falls into a dream upon a name.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Be happy softly, children, for a woe</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is on us, a great woe for little fame,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! in the old woods leave the mistletoe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And leave the holly for another year,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Its berries are too red.</span></p>

<h3><a class="pagebreak" name="page24" id="page24" title="24"></a>2</h3>

<p><span class="i0">And lovers, like to children, will not you</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cease for a little from your kissing mirth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thinking of other lovers that must go</span><br />
<span class="i0">Kissed back with fire into the bosom of earth,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! in the old woods leave the mistletoe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Be happy, softly, lovers, for you too</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall be as sad as they another year,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then for you the holly be berries of blood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And mistletoe strange berries of bitter tears.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! lovers, leave you your beatitude,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Give your sad eyes and ears</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the far griefs of neighbour and of friend,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page25" id="page25" title="25"></a>To the great loves that find a little end,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Long loves that in a sudden puff of fire</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a wild thought expire.</span></p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p><span class="i0">And you, ye merchants, you that eat and cheat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gold-seeking hucksters in a noble land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Think, when you lift the wine up in your hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of a fierce vintage tragically red,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Red wine of the hearts of English soldiers dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who ran to a wild death with laughing feet&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That we may sleep and drink and eat and cheat.</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page26" id="page26" title="26"></a>Ah! you brave few that fight for all the rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And die with smiling faces strangely blest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Because you die for England&mdash;O to do</span><br />
<span class="i0">Something again for you,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In this great deed to have some little part;</span><br />
<span class="i0">To send so great a message from the heart</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of England that one man shall be as ten,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hearing how England loves her Englishmen!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! think you that a single gun is fired</span><br />
<span class="i0">We do not hear in England. Ah! we hear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And mothers go with proud unhappy eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">That say: It is for England that he dies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">England that does the cruel work of God,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And gives her well beloved to save the world.</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page27" id="page27" title="27"></a>For this is death like to a woman desired,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For this the wine-press trod.</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p><span class="i0">And you in churches, praying this Christmas morn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pray as you never prayed that this may be</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little war that brought the great world peace;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Undazzled with its glorious infamy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O pray with all your hearts that war may cease,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And who knows but that God may hear the prayer.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So it may come about next Christmas Day</span><br />
<span class="i0">That we shall hear the happy children play</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gladly aloud, unmindful of the dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><a class="pagebreak" name="page28" id="page28" title="28"></a>And watch the lovers go</span><br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
